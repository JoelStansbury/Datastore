# Datastore
Python module which loads and saves data structures based on the file extension

Why can't python be more like my OS. I never have to explain how to read through a csv to windows. What? There are too many variables to consider? No says I. This module attempts to follow an extremely generic procedure for opening common data storage formats using only the file extension for guidance. If that fails, then yes, you probably should take the time to do it right. 

Currently supported file structures: CSV TSV JSON PICKLE (please let me know if you'd like to add more to this list)
